<h2>How to reach CEV ?<br></h2>

Calicut is well-connected with non-stop flights from Chennai, Mumbai, and Bangalore and direct flights from Hyderabad, Kolkata and Delhi.<br><br>
<h3>By Train<br></h3>

There are direct trains from Vatakara to all the main towns in Kerala as well as the major cities in India. Please alight at the Badagara railway station. From the railway station you may proceed to the Vatakara old bus stand (please see the paragraph for reaching CEV by bus). You may also board a pre-paid autorickshaw just outside the Badagara railway station (Autorickshaw charge will be around Rs. 180/-).<br><br>
